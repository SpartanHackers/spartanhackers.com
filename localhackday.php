            <h2>What is Local Hack Day?</h2>
            <p>Local Hack Day is a 12 hour mini-hackathon on Michigan State University's campus that brings together the local hacker community to celebrate building awesome technology. Other students around the world will be hosting their own Local Hack Days, resulting in the largest single day of student hacking ever. Throughout the day, Major League Hacking will provide us with awesome livestreams, chatrooms, and fun activities that you can use to meet students in our community.
